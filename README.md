## App Description
- This iOS app allows users find a random restaurant based on their preferences(location, rating, price, category, etc.) by clicking Restie's app icon on the home page.
- If the user dislikes the restaurant or wants to change it, then they go back and click Restie's icon for a new restaurant.

- While a restaurant is displayed:
- The user can open directions to the restaurant with apple maps.
- The user can share the restaurant's Yelp link to their contacts.
- The user can call the restaurant's phone number.
